# a summary about you
summary: "I love to learn and I have recently completed my Master's degree from Florida Atlantic University, but in my spare time I still enjoy taking courses using sources like Udemy or Pluralsight to keep learning and to keep up-to-date with current technologies. In my spare time I enjoy socializing with friends and exploring new activities I haven't done before. I play chess and am an avid Dungeons & Dragons player, I am currently DMing for a group of friends, I enjoy the opportuniy to be creative and at the same time spend time with close friends."
